          <p>
            I was raised in California and grew up with a real love for cars.
            After buying a car I was proud of, I took meticulous care of it, and
            neighbors began asking me to do the same for theirs. Seeking a new
            challenge beyond my hometown, I moved to Raleigh, North Carolina,
            and founded Down To The Detail. I bring the same pride, patience,
            and high standards I learned on my own vehicle to every client’s
            car, using quality products, careful technique, and clear
            communication to deliver consistent results.
